iHeartRadio Code Test - Auto iPhone
===================================

Thank you for your interest in iHeartRadio. Here is the Code Test.

Your task is to create a very simple app to view JIRA tickets. In this directory, you will find an archive file called SimpleTicket.zip - inside is your starter Xcode project, complete with git repository.

Here is the functional specification for the completed code test:

1. The application should read the following chunk of static JSON from a file:

```
{
	
	"Ticket URLs": [
		"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/JRA-9",
		"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/JRA-14",
		"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/JRA-27",
		"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/JRA-98"
	]
}
```


2. It should extract some information from those URLs and display it to the user.

There are no other requirements. You should focus on satisfying those requirements in the simplest possible fashion.

Please spend no more than 60 minutes on this code test--the expectation is you will be able to get something working in around a half hour.

Good luck!
