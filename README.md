Code test for a gig at IHeartRadio.  Here we're parsing Atlassian JIRA tickets spewed back to us in JSON.

The actual code test description is in the "Coding Test" document.  The initial version was done within an hour, with incremental updates a couple times just because I couldn't help but polish things here and there.
